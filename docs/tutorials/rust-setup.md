# Setting up a dev container for Rust

* Primary author: [Ayush Pai](https://github.com/ayushTheunc)
* Reviewer: [Max Yu](https://github.com/myu123)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

!!! note
    Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed before proceeding. Missing any of these tools may lead to issues later.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

1. Open your terminal and create a new directory for your Rust project:
   ```bash
   mkdir rust-project
   cd rust-project
   ```
2. Initialize a new Git repository locally:
   ```bash
   git init
   echo "# Rust Project" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
   ```

!!! tip
    Use meaningful commit messages to help keep your repository organized and easy to navigate.

---

### Step 2: Create a Remote Repository and Link It

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository named `rust-project`.
2. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license.
3. Back in your terminal, add the remote repository to your local Git repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/rust-project.git
   ```
4. Push your initial commit to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

!!! warning
    Be cautious when pasting your GitHub repository URL. Make sure it is correct to avoid linking to the wrong repository.

---

### Step 3: Configure the Development Container in VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code by selecting **File > Open Folder** and navigating to your `rust-project` directory.
2. In the Explorer pane, right-click and select **New Folder**, then name it `.devcontainer`.
3. Inside the `.devcontainer` folder, create a new file named `devcontainer.json` and add the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Rust Dev Container",
     "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/rust:latest",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": ["rust-lang.rust-analyzer"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Use the integrated terminal (Ctrl+` or View > Terminal) to add and commit the new files:
   ```bash
   git add .devcontainer
   git commit -m "Add dev container configuration"
   ```

!!! info
    The `devcontainer.json` file specifies the configuration for your development environment, including the base image (`rust:latest`) and the VS Code extension for Rust.

---

### Step 4: Open the Dev Container in VS Code

1. From the Command Palette:
   - **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd+Shift+P`.
2. Select **Reopen in Container**.
3. Wait for the container to build and initialize.

!!! warning
    Ensure Docker is running before reopening in the container. Otherwise, VS Code will not be able to build the container.

---

### Step 5: Initialize a Rust Project in the Dev Container

1. Inside the integrated terminal in VS Code, verify your Rust installation by checking the version:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```
   Ensure the displayed version is recent and supported.

2. Initialize a new Rust module:
   ```bash
   cargo new helloCOMP423 --bin --vcs none
   ```

!!! note
    The `--bin` flag creates a binary (executable) Rust project, and `--vcs none` prevents Cargo from initializing a new Git repository.

3. Inside the `helloCOMP423` directory, modify the file `main.rs` with the following content:
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, COMP423!");
   }
   ```

!!! tip
    Use the Rust `println!` macro to print text to the console. The `!` signifies it is a macro, not a regular function.

---

### Step 6: Compile and Run the Project in the Dev Container

1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
   This generates a binary file in the `target/debug/` directory. The `cargo build` command is similar to the `gcc` command in C programming (as used in COMP211). Like `gcc`, `cargo build` compiles your source code into an executable file that does not require the Rust environment to run.

!!! success
    If the compilation is successful, youâ€™ll find the compiled binary in the `target/debug/` directory.

2. Run the compiled binary directly:
   ```bash
   ./target/debug/helloCOMP423
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   Hello COMP423
   ```

3. Alternatively, use the following command to compile and run in one step:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

!!! question
    Why use `cargo build` over `cargo run`?  
    Use `cargo build` if you plan to run the binary multiple times. It saves time by avoiding repeated compilation.

   **Key Difference**: `cargo build` creates a reusable binary file, whereas `cargo run` compiles and executes the program in a single step.

---

### Step 7: Push Updates to GitHub from VS Code

1. Add and commit the Rust project files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add basic Rust project with Hello COMP423"
   ```

2. Push the latest changes to GitHub using the integrated terminal:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

!!! tip
    Regularly push your changes to keep your GitHub repository up to date.

## Final Steps

Congratulations! Your Rust project is now set up with a dev container and linked to a GitHub repository.
